🤖 Smart Recruiter AI: A RAG-Based Agentic Resume Screener

Project Status: Completed (v2.0)Primary Tech Stack: Python, Docling, OpenSearch, Google Gemini, Streamlit1. Executive SummaryThe Problem: Traditional Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) rely on brittle keyword matching. They often reject qualified candidates because of resume formatting issues (columns, tables) or synonyms (e.g., rejecting "Team Lead" when looking for "Manager"). Furthermore, manual screening is slow and prone to unconscious bias.The Solution: The Smart Recruiter AI is an intelligent agent that "reads" resumes like a human. It uses Docling for layout-aware parsing, OpenSearch for Hybrid Search (Keywords + Vectors), and Google Gemini for reasoning. It scores candidates based on a Job Description (JD), calculates experience mathematically, effectively removes bias via "Blind Mode," and provides explainable metrics for every decision.2. System ArchitectureThe system follows a modern RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) architecture enhanced with Agentic Reasoning.ComponentTechnologyRole in SystemIngestion EngineDocling (IBM)Parses complex PDFs (multi-column, tables) into structured Markdown.Vector DatabaseOpenSearchStores resume chunks. Performs Hybrid Search (k-NN Vectors + BM25 Keywords).Reasoning EngineGemini 1.5 FlashExtracts criteria from JDs, evaluates candidates, and generates email drafts.Frontend UIStreamlitProvides an interactive dashboard for HR to upload JDs and compare candidates.ContainerizationDockerHosts the OpenSearch single-node cluster locally.Data Pipeline FlowIngestion (ETL): PDF Resume $\to$ Docling Layout Analysis $\to$ Semantic Chunking $\to$ Gemini Embedding $\to$ OpenSearch Index.Retrieval (RAG): User uploads JD $\to$ Criteria Extraction $\to$ Hybrid Query Construction $\to$ OpenSearch Retrieval (Top-K).Inference (Agent): Retrieved Content $\to$ Gemini Evaluation (Fit Score/Strengths/Weaknesses) $\to$ Streamlit UI.3. Key Technical FeaturesA. Semantic Chunking (The "Precision" Upgrade)Standard RAG splits documents arbitrarily (e.g., every 500 characters). This breaks context.Our Approach: We implemented a custom splitter that detects Markdown headers (## Experience, ## Education) generated by Docling.Benefit: When searching for "Python," the system matches the specific "Technical Skills" section rather than a vague mention in a project description 3 pages down.B. Hybrid Search (The "Recall" Upgrade)Pure vector search often misses specific IDs or rare keywords. Pure keyword search misses synonyms.Our Approach: We combine k-NN (Vector) search for concept matching ("Financial Risk" $\approx$ "Credit Modeling") with BM25 (Keyword) boosting for critical hard skills.Deduplication: The backend implements logic to aggregate multiple matching chunks and return only the single "best" version of a candidate.C. Agentic "Blind Mode" (Bias Removal)To support DE&I (Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion) initiatives, the system includes a toggle to anonymize candidates.Implementation: The prompt instructs the LLM to redact Personally Identifiable Information (PII) like Names, Addresses, and University names during the analysis phase, replacing them with "Candidate X."D. Mathematical ReasoningUnlike standard search, this tool calculates.Example: If a candidate lists "2018-2020" and "2021-Present," the Agent calculates the total years of experience to compare against the JD's requirement (e.g., "Must have 5+ years").4.

5. Installation & Setup GuidePrerequisitesPython 3.10+Docker Desktop (installed and running)Google AI Studio API KeyStep 1: Environment SetupClone the repository and install dependencies.Bash# Create virtual environment (optional but recommended)
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # or venv\Scripts\activate on Windows

# Install libraries
pip install -r requirements.txt
Step 2: Database InitializationSpin up the OpenSearch container.Bashdocker compose up -d
Verify by visiting http://localhost:5601 in your browser.Step 3: ConfigurationCreate a .env file in the root directory:PlaintextGEMINI_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here
OPENSEARCH_HOST=localhost
OPENSEARCH_PORT=9200
Step 4: Data IngestionPlace PDF resumes into the data/ folder and run the ETL script.Bashpython ingest.py
Output: Logs will show semantic chunking and successful indexing of documents.Step 5: Launch ApplicationStart the web interface.Bashstreamlit run app.py
6. Usage WalkthroughUpload Job Description: Drag and drop a standard PDF Job Description into the sidebar.Automatic Parsing: The system extracts key requirements (e.g., "Must have 5 years Python," "Nice to have: AWS").Candidate Scoring:The dashboard displays candidates ranked by Fit Score (0-100%).Scores are color-coded: Green (80+), Orange (60-79), Red (<60).Deep Dive:Expand the "Strengths & Weaknesses" section for detailed AI feedback.Click "Interview Questions" to see AI-generated questions targeting the candidate's specific weak spots.Comparison: Select exactly two candidates and click "Generate Head-to-Head Comparison" for a side-by-side table view.Action: Click "Draft Rejection" to generate a polite, context-aware email template for rejected candidates.7. Future RoadmapGPU Acceleration: Enable docling to use CUDA for faster OCR on large datasets.Cloud Deployment: Dockerize the Streamlit app for deployment on AWS/Azure.Feedback Loop: Allow recruiters to "Rate" the AI's suggestions to fine-tune the prompts over time.Author[Your Name]Advanced Data Science Associate | ZS AssociatesSpecialization: GenAI, RAG, and Large Scale Data Processing
